## <a name="Cloning"></a> Cloning
This repository contains submodules for external dependencies, so when doing a fresh clone you need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan.git
``` 

Existing repositories can be updated manually:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## <a name="Assets"></a> Assets
Many examples require assets from the asset pack that is not part of this repository due to file size. A python script is included to download the asset pack that. Run

    python download_assets.py

from the root of the repository after cloning or see [this](data/README.md) for manual download.

## <a name="Building"></a> Building

The repository contains everything required to compile and build the examples on <img src="./images/windowslogo.png" alt="" height="22px" valign="bottom"> Windows using a C++ compiler that supports C++11.

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for details on how to build for the different platforms.

#### [01 - Triangle](examples/triangle/)
Basic and verbose example for getting a colored triangle rendered to the screen using Vulkan. This is meant as a starting point for learning Vulkan from the ground up. A huge part of the code is boilerplate that is abstracted away in later examples.
