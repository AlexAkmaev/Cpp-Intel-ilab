## <a name="Cloning"></a> Cloning
This repository contains submodules for external dependencies, so when doing a fresh clone you need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AlexAkmaev/Cpp-Intel-ilab.git
``` 

Existing repositories can be updated manually:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

## <a name="Building"></a> Building

The repository contains everything required to compile and build the examples on Windows using a C++ compiler that supports C++11.

See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for details on how to build in details.

#### [01 - Triangle](MAIN_PROJECT/triangle/)
Building a set of green triangles, which are repainted red at the intersection. This project is a modified copy of the Sasha Williams project referenced below. The changed fragments are marked with "//***CHANGED***BEG" and "//***CHANGED***END".List of modified files as well as those added to the original project:
1. In the folder shaders {PATH}/Problem3_Vulkan/shaders/*vert and shaders/*fraq are changed.
2. Triangle header files have been added to the MAIN_PROJECT folder.hpp and Geometry.hpp, which are inserted into the main triangle.cpp. In the latter, the main function as well as the methods of the VulkanExample class are changed.
3. The tests folder has been added to the {PATH}/Problem3_Vulkan folder.
4. After building the project, the build folder will appear in the {PATH}/Problem3_Vulkan folder, which is used to run the program and tests.
