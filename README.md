# Cpp-Intel-ilab
Tasks from the course of Vladimirov Konstantin Igorevich (Intel).
1. The intersection of the triangles.
Contains 3 levels of tasks:
-at the first level, the area of intersection of triangles is calculated;
-at the second level, the numbers of triangles that intersect in space are displayed;
-at the third level, all triangles from the second level are displayed using the Vulcan API.
2. Search for permutations.
Modified task #68 from the ProjectEuler.net. We search for all possible combinations of triples of numbers such that the sum of the numbers in triples is the same and a grid of numbers with an internal and external n-gon ring is formed from these triples.
